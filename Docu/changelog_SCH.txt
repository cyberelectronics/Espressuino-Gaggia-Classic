Espressuino_v1.2_SCH  --- 08.10.13

Added: C22 - 100nF capacitor for Volumetric sensor interrupt pin.

Modified: R13, Q2, Backlight control removed. Now LCD_D7 is connected to this pin.
          Volumetric sensor pulse output, connected to PD2 ( INT0 interrupt pin).
          ADC7 connections removed.

Espressuino_v1.1_SCH  --- 02.09.13

Added: R23 and R24 current limiting resistors for SSRs (Grinder and Electrovalve)

Modified: C13 from 10nF to 1uF for more stable readings of pressure.
          Electrovalve control connected to PB1 and Buzzer connected to PB5.
          There was a problem with using PB5 for Electrovalve. 
          This pin is always activated at startup by the bootloader, for a fraction of a second.
